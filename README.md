# To-Do List Web App

This project is a simple to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It allows users to add tasks to a list, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list.

## Overview

The web app provides a straightforward interface to manage tasks for the day. Users can add tasks by typing them into the input field and pressing the "Ekle" (Add) button. The entered task appears on the list, and users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on them or remove tasks using the delete button.

## Features

- **Adding Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Ekle" button to add it to the list.
- **Marking Tasks as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Click again to undo.
- **Deleting Tasks**: Each task has a delete button ('x') that removes the task from the list.
- **Feedback Toasts**: Toast messages show success when a task is added and error when attempting to add an empty task.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure of the web app.
- **css/style.css**: CSS file for styling the web app.
